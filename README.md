#Movie Trailer Website

This is an implementation of the Movie Trailer Website Project, part of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. Here's what it does:
- Creates a Python Class called `Movie` that serves as a data structure to store one's favorite movies, including movie title, poster URL, YouTube link to the movie trailer and it's storyline.
- Creates multiple instances of the `Movie` class to represent one's favorite movies; groups all the instances together in a list.
- Includes the provided Python module called `fresh_tomatoes.py` to help generate a website that displays these movies. This module has a function called `open_movies_page` that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of one's favorite movies.
- Ensures that the website renders correctly when one attempts to load it in a browser.
